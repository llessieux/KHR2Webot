# KHR2Webot

Components for the KHR2 Robots (From Kondo) simulation in Webots software

This project was done in 2006/2007 and it is not supported anymore.

Storing the files for safekeeping.

Webots has since gone to opensource apparently

See https://cyberbotics.com/

It might be a lot easier to port my old code to the new framework now.
